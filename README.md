# System specifications

- All drugs have an `expiresIn` value which denotes the number of days we have until the item expires.
- All drugs have a `benefit` value which denotes how powerful the drug is.
- At the end of each day our system lowers both values for every drug

But there is more:

- Once the expiration date has passed, Benefit degrades twice as fast.
- The Benefit of an item is never negative.
- "Herbal Tea" actually increases in Benefit the older it gets,
- The Benefit of an item is never more than 50.
- "Magic Pill" never expires nor decreases in Benefit.
- "Fervex", like Herbal Tea, increases in Benefit as its expiration date approaches. Benefit increases by 2 when there are 10 days or less and by 3 when there are 5 days or less but Benefit drops to 0 after the expiration date.

We have recently signed a supplier of "Dafalgan". This requires an update to our system:

- "Dafalgan" degrades in Benefit twice as fast as normal drugs.


## Test

To make sure that you will not break anything in the existing code, we added a log of the simulation in the _output.txt_ file. You can generate a new file by running one of the following commands:

```sh
yarn start
```
